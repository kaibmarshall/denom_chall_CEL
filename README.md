# Denomination Counter
Hello and thank you for taking the time to look at my program. This program asks the user for a dollar amount, then
returns the minimum amount of each US denomination needed to make change for that amount. 

## Running the program

These instructions assume the user has their C++ compiler already installed. 

1. Download this repo
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the downloaded repo folder e.g. `cd C:/Users/YourName/Downloads/denom_chall_CEL`
3. Compile the program by typing `g++ main.cpp -o main`
4. Run the program by typing `"./main"` (quotes included)
